      <description>I know, I know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this in a long time. Well, I got a job, and that took me away from my own sideprojects for a while. Two months, to be exact :melting_face:&#xA;This job market has been so rough, it has really been chewing me up and spitting me out. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through at least 3 if not 4 rounds of interviews (AT LEAST) with 10 companies in total this year, only to not get an offer without any actionable feedback.</description>

      <description>I declare this my first official blog post! This blog may end up meandering quite a bit, topic-wise, as I navigate writing and learning new code for fun and being laid off for the first time in my life. I was part of a large RIF layoff at Scuba Analytics on 5/7, so it&amp;rsquo;s been about two weeks. I am trying to not get disheartened by the current job market but IT IS SO HARD!</description>
