      <description>I know, I know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this in a long time. Well, I got a job, and that took me away from my own sideprojects for a while. Two months, to be exact :melting_face:&#xA;This job market has been so rough, it has really been chewing me up and spitting me out. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through at least 3 if not 4 rounds of interviews (AT LEAST) with 10 companies in total this year, only to not get an offer without any actionable feedback.</description>

      <description>I declare this my first official blog post! This blog may end up meandering quite a bit, topic-wise, as I navigate writing and learning new code for fun and being laid off for the first time in my life. I was part of a large RIF layoff at Scuba Analytics on 5/7, so it&amp;rsquo;s been about two weeks. I am trying to not get disheartened by the current job market but IT IS SO HARD!</description>

      <description>I have been wanting to contribute to something open source forever but never had the chance to, or in some cases, wasn&amp;rsquo;t contractually allowed to due to working in healthcare etc. But now that I find myself laid off (AGAIN), I am a free agent and have been looking for where to even begin. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the etiquette, and most of my really strong interests right now are NOT things I am professionally good at, like working with AI tools and blockchain.</description>

      <description>About me Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Kirsten, and I&amp;rsquo;m a native New Yorker transplant to the Minneapolis area. I like Kuberentes, wrangling Linux servers, finding chances to still write code as a DevOps engineer and automating things away. I also am a mom of two little kiddos, a powerlifter and death metal drummer.&#xA;My Resume Repos [A WIP collection of scripts for Linux technical interviews] (https://github.com/reinainblood/linux_interview_simulations) [This site, created with Go and Hugo] (https://github.</description>

      <description>I have been super frustrated with the current hiring process for tech companies. I am going through so many round of interviews and getting attached to companies, getting to know people really well, making friends, even, and then at the end, either somebody else gets the offer or the company decides to not hire ANYBODY. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have spent so many hours preparing for these interviews if I knew there were multiple other, more qualified candidates two steps ahead of me in the pipeline, tbh.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s officially been &amp;ldquo;too long&amp;rdquo; for me to be laid-off, both financially and mentally. Not going to lie, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get a little stressed out. If anybody wants to hire me to write Go code or manage Kubernetes clusters or both, please email me!&#xA;I also have an updated resume pdf hosted here if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&#xA;Much appreciated!</description>
