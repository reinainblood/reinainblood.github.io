Well, it's officially been "too long" for me to be laid-off,
both financially and mentally. Not going to lie, I'm starting
to get a little stressed out. If anybody wants to hire me to 
write Go code or manage Kubernetes clusters or both, please
[email me!]([mailto://kirstenruge@gmail.com])

I also have [an updated resume pdf](resume.pdf)
hosted here if you'd like.

Much appreciated!
